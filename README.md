# BackupWizard

# Just a simple backup wizard I wrote using C#, straightforward and no b*llshit.
# What it basically do is take a backup to your desired folder whether a file inside is opened, it will still make a backup.
# Reason for this is that on my logic, it will copy first a temp folder from the target folder and then zip that temp folder, so basically
# we didn't touch the target folder. Downside is that sometimes if the target folder's size is bigger, the time it'll take to make the process will also be longer. (Depending on your machine)
